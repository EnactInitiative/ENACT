            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>My name is Preet Bhavsar. I started rescuing kittens that were out in the cold when I was in fifth grade. Since then, I've dedicated my time and efforts to help community animals in our everyday life. It's my passion to ensure that these animals are safe, healthy, and cared for.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Our nonprofit organization is committed to helping community animals. We provide shelter, medical care, and food for stray and abandoned animals. We also work to find loving homes for these animals and educate the community about the importance of animal welfare. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of these animals.</p>
